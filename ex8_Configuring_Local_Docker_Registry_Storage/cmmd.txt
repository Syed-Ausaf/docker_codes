1. Create the test_registry directory in your home directory:
mkdir /home/vincesesto/test_registry/
2. Run the local registry, but in this instance, include the -v option, which connects
the directory you created in the preceding step to the container directory of /
var/lib/registry. Also, use the :rw option to make sure you can both read
and write to the directory:
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry -v /home/
vincesesto/test_registry/registry:/var/lib/registry:rw registry
3. Now, push the image to your newly mounted registry as you normally would:
docker push dev.docker.local:5000/basic-app:ver1
4. To verify that the images are now being stored in your newly mounted
directory, list the files in the registry/docker/registry/v2/
repositories/ directory.
ls ~/test_registry/registry/docker/registry/v2/repositories/
You should see the new images you have just pushed in the previous step:
basic-app
This activity has allowed us to start working with some more advanced Docker options.
